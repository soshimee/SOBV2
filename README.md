# SOBV2
soshimee's OWOP Bot v2
Best free bots for OWOP.

* Automatic OPM loader and bundled OWOP.js.
* WebSocket support for power users.
* The only public bot to have built-in text paste feature.

HOW TO RUN:
1. Copy the contents of `sobv2.min.js`.
2. Paste it in the browser console for OWOP (CTRL+SHIFT+J).
3. If you do not have OPM installed already, it will take a few moments to load it automatically.

This was brought free & open source because I wasn't interested anymore. I'll still fix bugs though if you find any.
PRs and issues open.
